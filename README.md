# password-generator-2
Second attempt at password generator!

This web application project is a password generator, meant to demonstrate some knowledge on the JavaScript principles covered in class so far. 

Due to time constraints and the general pace of boot camp, I was unable to get my password generator to work completely, but I did utilize many JavaScript concepts to achieve some of the desired functionality. Many of the intended, but incomplete code blocks include comments explaining my intention and next steps if given enough time to research and execute. 

I also utilized an official BootCampSpot tutorial session to discuss this project with a seasoned software engineer.  He was extremely knowledgeable and quite helpful, but solved this case using principles that our class has not yet covered.  So although I do have a working password generator repo in my GitHub, I have chosen to submit one that I built from scratch after the tutorial session, strictly utilizing the concepts covered in class.  

You can find the very elegant tutor-inspired code in the "password-generator" repo (https://github.com/KGlinoga/password-generator).  My submission for this assignment is "password-generator-2".  


## Usage

The purpose of this web app is to provide the user a password that meets certain criteria, like length, and what characters are used.  The app prompts the user to input their required criteria, and once those are accepted, the app displays a password that meets said criteria. 

The generator is meant to produce the password by randomly choosing characters from an array of characters built from the user's input. 

The first prompt is triggered by the "Generate Password" button.

## Credits

My collaborators include the BootCampSpot tutor, some instructor feedback during Office Hours, and my resources include W3Schools and MDN.  Many of these resources showed excellent solutions that did not adhere to our class' curriculum. So although they were fascinating, I did not incorporate many of the principles discussed outside of class.
